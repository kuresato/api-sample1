## Overview  
This server was generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) project.
By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://openapis.org), you can easily generate a server stub.
This is an example of building a OpenAPI-enabled server in Java using the SpringBoot framework.

The underlying library integrating OpenAPI to SpringBoot is [springfox](https://github.com/springfox/springfox)

Start your server as a simple java application

You can view the api documentation in swagger-ui by pointing to  
http://localhost:8080/
